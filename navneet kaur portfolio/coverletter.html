        <b>Dear members of the Admissions Committee / Portfolio Review Board<em> ,</em></b><p>
        <p>I am writing to submit my portfolio for consideration as part of my application to the Social Service Worker Program at Sheridan College. With a passion for social justice and a commitment to serving vulnerable populations, I am eager to embark on the next phase of my academic and professional journey in the field of social work.</p>
        
        <p>Throughout my academic and professional experiences, I have gained valuable insights and developed essential skills that have prepared me for a career as a social service worker. My Social Service Worker Diploma from Sheridan College provided me with a strong foundation in social work theory, research, and practice, while my eight months of experience working in the field during my practicum allowed me to apply these principles in real-world settings.</p>
        
        <p>In addition to my academic and professional experiences, I am deeply committed to social justice and advocacy. Whether volunteering at a retirement home, I am dedicated to creating positive change and promoting the well-being of all members of society.</p>
        
        <p>Thank you for considering my application and reviewing my portfolio. I am excited about the possibility of joining the Social Service Worker Department at Sheridan College and contributing to the vibrant community of scholars and practitioners dedicated to social change and service.</p>
        
        <p>Sincerely <em> ,</em></p>
        <p>Navneet Kaur</p>
